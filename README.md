- Atleast one female member
- At least 1 mentor, but a max limit of 2 mentor is imposedV
    <!-- Source: https://www.sih.gov.in/faqs -->
    - A Mentor is "*any senior faculty and domain expert that will guide the team and nurture their idea*"


## Requirements as stated from the problem description
- Solution goals:
    - As of the moment, the solution to the following problem is restricted locally to India
    - Improving tourism and related sectors
    - Soak up the increase in the costal tourism market
    - Safety of the tourist
- Mobile Application:
    - Indicating the suitability of beaches for:
        - Recreational activities
            - Based on ocean states like wave heights/ocean currents, meteorologivcal paremeters like win, water quality
            - High Wave/Swell Surge/Ocean Currents/Storm Surge/Tsunami
            - Winds, Water quality assessments
    - Display the suitable/viability of the tourist's trip to the beaches in India
    - Users can search coastal location for recreation activities
    - Create locations of different beaches across the country
    - "*The application should devise a method/algorithm to use the above parameters and make the safety/suitability decision at the different locations*"
    - "*Visualization using geospatial maps and colour codes based on suitability of locations*"
    - "*Based on the current location of the user, alert notifications to be provided in case of any alerts in the coastal location of the user to be provided*"

## Expected Solution as stated from the problem description:
"*Design and development of a mobile application which identifies suitability of coastal tourism sites based on the current weather and oceanic conditions. This can help to save lives and better plan the coastal tourist/recreational activities for the user*"
